Object Sync for Salesforce maps and syncs data between Salesforce objects and WordPress objects. It is based on the [Drupal Salesforce Suite](https://github.com/thinkshout/salesforce) (version 7.x-3.x-dev), but works in a very WordPress way.

== Description ==

This plugin maps and syncs data between Salesforce objects and WordPress content types. For any supported WordPress content types (e.g. post, page, user, or any custom content type in your installation), you can assign Salesforce objects that will be created / updated / deleted when the data in WordPress is saved, and the WordPress objects can be created / updated / deleted when the data in Salesforce is saved.

Both of these directions act upon any matching data that is created after the plugin is installed. For each such assignment, you choose which WordPress and Salesforce fields should be mapped to one another.

This plugin also includes developer hooks that allow for additional plugins to modify what data the plugin is working with, or what happens upon specific events.

== Installation ==

### WordPress

#### Prerequisites

To install the plugin in WordPress, your PHP environment needs the following:

1. At least version 5.5.
2. SSL support (this is required to connect to Salesforce).
3. A domain where WordPress is successfully running. For purposes of this documentation, we'll assume that you are using `https://<your site>`. You would use `https://www.example.com` instead, if your site was `www.example.com`.

#### Activate the plugin

In the Plugins list in WordPress, activate the plugin and find the settings link (you can also find this plugin's settings in the main Settings list in WordPress, under the Salesforce menu item once it is activated).

The plugin's settings URL is `https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin`.

### Salesforce

#### Prerequisites

You'll need to have access to a Salesforce developer account. This should come with Enterprise Edition, Unlimited Edition, or Performance Edition. Developers can register for a free Developer Edition account at [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

We recommend using a Sandbox to set up this plugin first before running it in production.

For purposes of this documentation, we'll assume that your name, as defined in Salesforce, is Your Name. This is what you see at the top right of the browser window, when you are logged in.

#### Create an App

1. In Salesforce, go to `Your Name > Setup`. Then on the left sidebar, under `App Setup`, click `Create > Apps`. In the **Connected Apps** section of this page, click New to create a new app.
2. Enable OAuth Settings
3. Set the callback URL to: `https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=authorize` (must use HTTPS).
4. Select at least "Perform requests on your behalf at any time" for OAuth Scope as well as the appropriate other scopes for your application. Many setups will also need to select "Access and manage your data (api)" as one of these scopes.

#### Get the values for WordPress

After you save these settings, click Continue and you'll see the values for your new app. For WordPress, you'll need these values:

1. Consumer Key (in the screenshot, this value says "valuefromsalesforce")
2. Consumer Secret (you'll have to click "Click to reveal" to get this value)

### Connect the plugin to Salesforce

#### Settings

Go to the Settings tab for the plugin. It is the default URL that opens when you click Salesforce in the main Settings menu. Enter the values based on your Salesforce environment.

1. Consumer Key: (your value from above)
2. Consumer Secret: (your value from above)
3. Callback URL: `https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=authorize`
4. Login Base URL: For most Salesforce environments, you can use `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandbox, and `https://login.salesforce.com` for production.
5. Authorize URL Path: The plugin starts with a default of `/services/oauth2/authorize`. You should generally not have to change this.
6. Token URL Path: The plugin starts with a default of `/services/oauth2/token`. You should generally not have to change this.
7. Salesforce API Version: You should generally use the latest version your install has access to. This plugin starts with 39.0, but once it is authenticated the text field will be replaced with a dropdown of your available versions from which you can choose.
8. Limit Salesforce Objects: These allow you to indicate whether Salesforce should relate to objects that can't be triggered or updated via the API. Generally it's a good idea to have these boxes checked to avoid errors.
9. Pull Throttle (seconds): This plugin starts with 5 seconds, but you can change it based on your server's needs.
10. Debug mode: This won't do anything until after the plugin has been authorized, but once it has you can use it to see more information about what the API is doing. **Don't check this in a production environment.**

Save the settings. If the values required are set, you'll see a message that says "Salesforce needs to be authorized to connect to this website. Use the Authorize tab to connect." You can use that link for the next steps.

##### Using constants for settings

You can set several of the above values as constants in your `wp-config.php` file. The plugin will always use a constant ahead of a database setting.

Supported constant names are:

1. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_KEY
2. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_SECRET
3. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CALLBACK_URL
4. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_LOGIN_BASE_URL
5. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_AUTHORIZE_URL_PATH
6. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_TOKEN_URL_PATH
7. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_API_VERSION

Set them in `wp-config.php` like this:

`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_KEY', 'valuefromsalesforce');`
`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_SECRET', 'valuefromsalesforce');`
`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CALLBACK_URL', 'https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=authorize');`
`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_LOGIN_BASE_URL', 'https://test.salesforce.com');`
`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_API_VERSION', '40.0');`
`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_AUTHORIZE_URL_PATH', '/services/oauth2/authorize');`
`define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_TOKEN_URL_PATH', '/services/oauth2/token');`

For any value that is already defined in `wp-config.php`, the Settings screen will display "Defined in wp-config.php" in place of the text field.

#### Authorize

Go to the Authorize tab in the plugin's settings. If it is not yet authorized, you'll see a message that says "Salesforce needs to be authorized to connect to this website. Use the Authorize tab to connect."

The authorize tab will force you to be logged in using HTTPS, if you weren't already.

Steps:

1. Click the Connect to Salesforce button to authenticate WordPress with your Salesforce installation.
2. You may have to log into Salesforce.
3. Salesforce will ask you to allow access to the app (in these instructions, the name is WordPress Example), and will show you what permissions it needs.
4. Click Allow.
5. You'll be redirected back to WordPress. Don't do anything until you see a message that says "Salesforce is successfully authenticated."
6. The tab will display a "Disconnect from Salesforce" button which you can click at any time, and will also show a bit of basic information about your Salesforce environment (the available API versions and a basic table of Contacts.)
7. If you'd like to use a different Salesforce API version, go back to the Settings tab and pick your desired version from the dropdown.

### More documentation

There is extensive documentation of the plugin, including its developer hooks, [on GitHub](https://github.com/MinnPost/object-sync-for-salesforce/blob/master/docs/readme.md). You can find a detailed [initial setup instruction](https://github.com/MinnPost/object-sync-for-salesforce/blob/master/docs/initial-setup.md) document there as well.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Mapping custom fields

WordPress stores metadata as key/value pairs in its database. Many plugins and themes use this method to store custom field data. Object Sync for Salesforce supports mapping these fields (many other plugins use non-standard methods, and this plugin may or may not support them).

Object Sync for Salesforce, however, cannot see meta fields before there is at least one value in the database. For example, if you have a "testfield" on your user object, it wonâ€™t be in the fieldmap options until there is at least one user that has a value for the field.

If you load Object Sync for Salesforce and then store data for a new meta field after this load, make sure you click the "Clear the plugin cache" link on the Fieldmaps tab.

### Using with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)

Object Sync for Salesforce does not and will not "officially" support ACF because you don't have to use ACF to use WordPress or to use Salesforce. However, they are **generally** usable together.

Things to know:

1. See the answer above about custom fields. Any ACF field must have at least one value in the database before Object Sync for Salesforce can map it.
2. When you try to map an ACF field, you'll see one that has an underscore in front of it, and one that does not. This is because ACF uses both for its own purposes. As long as you map the ACF field that **does not** have the underscore in front of it, you should be able to get data to and from Salesforce. For example, you could map a `test_field` to a `Contact_description` field. The fieldmap screen will show a `_test_field` in the dropdown, but you should be able to safely ignore that, and only map `test_field`.

While we will not include code that only runs for ACF in this plugin, we would happily point to any add-on plugin that uses Object Sync for Salesforce hooks to build a more comprehensive integration with ACF for all users who install this plugin while they're running ACF.

### Using with WooCommerce

Object Sync for Salesforce doesn't have, and will not have, intentional support for WooCommerce. It kind of supports it, to the extent that WooCommerce uses WordPress' default ways of creating objects and data. WooCommerce is very complicated, and on top of that it often deviates from those default WordPress methods, and it's certainly possible that this plugin won't support it when it does.

This doesn't mean you can't use them together, but it does mean this plugin is not intentionally built for that purpose. Because WooCommerce is not a requirement to use WordPress, or to use Salesforce, it will never be built directly into Object Sync for Salesforce.

Object Sync for Salesforce does have abundant developer hooks, and WooCommerce has its own API, and it would be possible to build an add-on plugin to provide full support by integrating these (we would happily point to it for all users who install this plugin while they're running WooCommerce).

== Changelog ==

* 1.3.4 (2018-04-14)
	* Bug fix: this release refixes an issue in which a custom post object with custom fields was not sending its custom fields on the first save, causing it to fail if the fields were required in Salesforce. Thanks to WordPress users @rtd2 and @bill5roses for reporting that the previous fix was not sufficient.

* 1.3.3 (2018-03-31)
	* Bug fix: a modified Salesforce Contact, which is not mapped to a user in WordPress but when the fieldmap does exist, would try to create a new user in WordPress but fail to add the email address to the email field. Thanks to GitHub user @mcculloughcm for the report.
	* Bug fix: the key and prematch fields were ignored if their Salesforce status was not updateable, so this broke prematch checking in those cases. Thanks to GitHub user @johnpbloch for the report.
	* New: small tweaks to plugin readme, inline form text.

* 1.3.2 (2018-03-16)
	* Bug fix: this plugin would sometimes conflict with jQuery from other plugins, especially older ones. This puts the object into an enclosure instead.
	* Bug fix: allow mapped date fields to be empty without causing a push error.
	* Bug fix: make sure plugin notices only appear on pages related to this plugin.
	* Bug fix: doing an import with only one object map would fail.

* 1.3.1 (2018-03-11)
	* Bug fix: this release fixes an issue in which a custom post object with custom fields was not sending its custom fields on the first save, causing it to fail if the fields were required in Salesforce. Thanks to WordPress user @rtd2 for reporting this.
	* Bug fix: this release makes the data import preserve the field structure.

* 1.3.0 (2018-03-10)
	* New: this release adds an interface for importing and exporting plugin data. It includes fieldmaps (which map object types to each other), object maps (individual objects mapped to each other) and plugin settings. Data is exported to a single JSON file that can be imported.
	* Bug fix: this release supports a datetime change in MySQL versions newer than 5.7.4 in which default values can no longer be 0000-00-00. See this [StackOverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25349126/how-can-i-set-the-default-value-of-a-field-as-0000-00-00-000000) for details.
	* Bug fix: this release fixes an issue where admin notices for this plugin would sometimes be empty.
	* Also fixed a ton of code formatting stuff, including translation spots.
	* This release also fixes the previously broken Travis CI build's issues with older PHP versions.

* 1.2.8 (2018-03-09)
	* New: this release adds a new developer hook, `object_sync_for_salesforce_push_update_params_modify`, which allows the data being pushed to Salesforce to be modified in the event that an existing Salesforce object is being updated.
	* Bug fix: the install script adds `--prefer-dist` to the `composer install` to hopefully prevent issues on Pantheon. Thanks to WordPress user @joepahl for reporting this.
	* This releasse also makes a number of corrections and clarifications to the plugin documentation.

* 1.2.7 (2018-02-23)
	* Bug fix: in some cases, a fieldmap with the Salesforce update trigger checked, but not the Salesforce create trigger, it would still create data in WordPress. This data should, rather, be skipped.
	* New: there are also a number of small tweaks to in-page help, documentation and code comments.

* 1.2.6 (2018-01-30)
	* Bug fix: in some cases, date fields coming from Salesforce were not correctly formatted for use in WordPress. This release causes any core date fields to be formatted as WordPress expects them. Thanks to GitHub user @prowp for the report on this.
	* Note: to apply this fix, you need to clear the plugin cache, and then re-save any the fieldmap(s) that need it.
	* This release also includes a small documentation update about restricted picklist fields.

* 1.2.5 (2018-01-26)
	* Bug fix: trying to save a high number of fields in a single fieldmap was failing. Thanks to GitHub user @prowp for the report.
	* New: some in-page help to users who may be missing meta fields when trying to add them to a fieldmap. This happens if these meta fields are new fields without data, and thus cannot be found in the database by the plugin.
	* New: we now store the plugin version in the database when saving a fieldmap. This allows us to check fieldmaps to make sure they use the most up to date schema.

* 1.2.4 (2018-01-24)
	* This release fixes a rare bug in which Salesforce changes that occur between a query and the completion of the pull operation would not sync to WordPress. Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and the fix.
	* This release also removes the "weight" field from the screen that adds and edits fieldmaps. This field should have been removed in the past, as it doesn't currently do anything, although in the future we'd like to investigate the ability to map multiple WordPress objects to the same Salesforce object and sync them using the weight field.

* 1.2.3 (2018-01-19)
	* This release fixes a bug in which deleting field pairs from an existing fieldmap, saving, and then adding more field pairs could result in data not being saved. Thanks to WordPress user @pavelwld for reporting this.
	* This release also adds a Settings tab field to choose whether or not the plugin should delete its data when it is deactivated.

* 1.2.2 (2018-01-17)
	* This release fixes a bug in which an object map could not be created if the Salesforce ID was the same, with case insensitivity, as another Salesforce ID. Salesforce, however, is case sensitive with these IDs and can occasionally create IDs like this. Thanks to WordPress user @pavelwld for reporting this.

* 1.2.1 (2017-12-19)
	* This release fixes a bug caused in 1.2.0. Users were unable to sync data without re-saving fieldmaps. This does a version checker and uses previous data structures until users re-save.
	* Make sure you update your plugin fieldmaps.

* 1.2.0 (2017-12-18)
	* This release provides basic support for additional field types in Salesforce, including: multipicklist, picklist, date, datetime, and URL (results may vary depending on how WordPress plugins handle their custom field equivalents). Thanks to WordPress user @ilanabit for reporting this.
	* This release also forces InnoDB on the `field_map` table because MyISAM gets errors on the index length. Hopefully most users are already on InnoDB by default, but this will help any users who are not.

* 1.1.2 (2017-11-20)
	* Clarify the documentation, and the code, for the following developer hooks:
		* `object_sync_for_salesforce_add_more_wordpress_types`
		* `object_sync_for_salesforce_remove_wordpress_types`
		* `object_sync_for_salesforce_wordpress_object_data`
	* Thanks to WordPress user @justanothercoder for asking about this, leading to the fix.

* 1.1.1 (2017-11-17)
	* This release removes the `screen_icon()` method from admin.php. It has been deprecated apparently since 3.8, but in 4.9 it officially throws PHP Notice messages in `WP_DEBUG` mode.

* 1.1.0 (2017-11-10)
	* This release gives users a way to clear the cached data for this plugin only, even if they are using an object cache method. Most importantly this resolves the problem of new fields being available in Salesforce or WordPress and not being visible in the list of mappable fields when creating or updating a fieldmap. This is partly related to GitHub user @prowp's initial report of missing metadata.

* 1.0.11 (2017-11-06)
	* Fixed a bug in which a blank `post` object was created in the event that `pull` calls were blocked, then unblocked. Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and much of the fix.
	* Fixed a bug in which `post` meta fields were not pushed to Salesforce. Also as part of this, added basic support for WooCommerce `order` post types. Thanks to WordPress user @ratputin and GitHub user @prowp for the report.

* 1.0.10 (2017-10-10)

	* This avoids repeatedly queueing Salesforce objects by initializing rather than aggregating the queue before saving. This reduces memory use and database size significantly.
	* Plugin now updates the pull sync timestamp for the data type after every successful record queue. This provides a correct starting point for the next pull to begin in case of a fatal error.
	* Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and the pull request.

* 1.0.9 (2017-10-03)

	* This fixes a bug in which upserting a custom post type would incorrectly create a standard post, rather than the desired custom post object. Thanks to GitHub user @prowp for the report.

* 1.0.8 (2017-08-14)

	* This checks a mapping's configured allowed sync triggers before queueing a record for pull processing, rather than as a part of the WordPress record's create or update. This resolves an issue. Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and the pull request.
	* This release also fixes a bug related to 1.0.7, which after the fix was still incorrectly checking the `post_content` and `post_title` values.

* 1.0.7 (2017-08-01)

	* This sets up admin notices that always show above the plugin's admin tabs if: 1) the plugin is not authorized, 2) there are no fieldmaps, or 3) there is no schedule set up for the plugin. This is so users understand they have to do these things before the plugin can properly work.
	* Fixed a bug where `wp_insert_post` failed if the `post_content` or `post_title` values were not passed, but the map row was still created. This passes empty values for both fields if they aren't present. It also throws a `WP_Errror` object if either `wp_insert_post` or `wp_update_post` fail.
	* Also fixed some code formatting issues

* 1.0.6 (2017-07-05)

	* This builds a basic interface for object map rows that failed to be fully created to map objects between the two systems, and have a temporary ID for either WordPress or Salesforce.
	* If any of these rows are present in the database, it creates a Mapping Errors tab at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=mapping_errors`.
	* For each row, it shows the WordPress ID, WordPress object type, Salesforce ID, and when it was created. Users are able to edit each row's WordPress and/or Salesforce ID, in case the data they need to map does actually exist, and are also able to delete each row individually in case they just want to let the plugin run again.
	* This gives users a non SQL way to manage those error rows if they ever occur, on top of the previous PR on this branch that kept them from preventing further syncing.
	* **Noteworthy change:** in `salesforce_mapping` we now filter the `$posted` array so it only contains the columns in the database table for object maps, plus the `action` parameter that we filter out later. I've verified that the various `create_object_map` methods do not contain other parameters that we need to preserve for similar use to the `action`.

* 1.0.5 (2017-06-29)

	* Fixes an inconsistent scenario in which the plugin created object map rows with a WordPress or Salesforce ID of 0 and then failed to sync new objects because of the database key. Here's how:
		- Change the wordpress_id field on the map table to be a varchar instead of an integer (updating the plugin from the wordpress repo will automatically update this, but users who update manually will need to do it manually)
		- when creating an object map between two items, plugin creates a temporary id value for whichever system does not have the item (ie a temporary wordpress id if we're on a salesforce pull action). This replaces the value of 0 that the plugin previously used before updating the database with the correct id value.
		- This way if the api fails, server goes down, whatever, that tmp id is unique down to the milisecond. The database key can stay, making sure duplicate ids do not get mapped and such, but in a worst case scenario there are rows that keep the temp id because the operation failed. They can be tracked down to when they happened and whether it was a push or pull that failed, by looking up that ID in the database.
	* Also updates documentation to be more clear about how the plugin works with data that exists prior to installation (mostly it doesn't, with some tiny manual exceptions).

* 1.0.4 (2017-06-12)

	* Fix the tested version again, as it was reverted

* 1.0.3 (2017-06-09)

	* Update the deploy file so it keeps .git, .gitignore, etc. items out of the deployed plugin

* 1.0.2 (2017-06-09)

	* Update tested WordPress version to reflect 4.8
	* Some basic preparation work for supporting the Salesforce SOAP API
	* Update dependencies

* 1.0.1 (2017-06-05)
