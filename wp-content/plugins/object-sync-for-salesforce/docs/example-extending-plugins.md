If you create any of your own, please [submit a pull request to this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request), or [create an issue](https://github.com/minnpost/object-sync-for-salesforce/issues), and tell us as much as you'd like us to know about the plugin. We don't guarantee putting any plugin submitted to us on this page. It may also be useful to tag your GitHub repository (if you have one) with `object-sync-for-salesforce` for easier discovery.

## Plugins created by MinnPost (the developer of this plugin)

1. [MinnPost WordPress Salesforce Plugin](https://github.com/MinnPost/minnpost-wordpress-salesforce-plugin) - uses various hooks to extend the plugin for our needs. For us, this is especially related to our membership efforts.
2. [MinnPost Donation Progress Widget](https://github.com/MinnPost/minnpost-donation-progress-widget) - uses the Salesforce Analytics API included in this plugin to build a donation progress widget. It is perhaps not very universal, as it depends on how we set up our campaigns for membership drives.
